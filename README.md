# nfl-fan-data

I did this project to scrape an intesting infographic made by Twitter that displays percentage of fans for each NFL team by US county. With 32 teams and 3127 counties that's 100,064 data points! Not something that you would want to do by hand. Because of the way they store the data (serialized JSON object), I could not simply scrape all of the HTML at once. After looking into the process of deserializing JSON data with Javascript, a language which I had very little experience with at the time, I arrived at another solution. I would use Seleniums ability to hover a mouse over a specified object (in this case a tile) and scrape the HTML tooltip info. Not the most elegant solution but it got the job done and looks pretty cool in action.
